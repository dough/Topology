<p>Formally a dcpo means a “directed-complete” partially ordered set.</p>
<p>DEFINE: S is directed if every finite subset has an upper bound.</p>
<p>This goes a little farther than saying that there is no entity without any of their properties, it says there is an individual who does reject them all.</p>
<p>In a dcpo such a decision process will reach a result. WOW! Of course the question now will be, how do you find a dcpo.</p>
<p>DEFINE: X is a dcpo if every directed ^-set has a lub.</p>
<p>Saying it has an ub would just say “there are entities”; this says “there is one and only one”.</p>
<p>Not too surprisingly there is a way to phrase this in our filter language. A directed set generates a nice kind of filter, called a UF for “union filter”.</p>
<p>DEFINE: O^p is a UF if every element meets the limit set of the filter. That turns out to mean that the limit set actually belongs to the dual. Another way to see this is that every element is the limit of a NF which belongs to the dual.</p>
<p>You might want to compare; we have already learned that in a JF every element is a limit of a fJF which belongs to the dual. Yes, these are NOT the same thing: there are fJF which are not NF.</p>
<p>In fact:</p>
<p>FACT: every jJF is a NF iff every JF is a UF.</p>
<p>A space is called <strong>sober</strong> if every UF is a NF. There are those who believe that we should only consider sober spaces, actually for a variety of reasons. (I am not one of thos because my favorite type of space, the poset, is not always sober).</p>
<p>A UF is prime, of course, since any union of PF is a PF (we already lnow a join even of NF may not be a PF). But a UF has an even stronger version. which is often called <strong>completely prime</strong>.</p>
<p>FACT: O^p is a UF iff whenever a member is a union of members one of those is already a member.</p>
<p>In other words taking unions of members does not give you anything new. A PF was defined, you may remember, by that same statement, limited to joins (that is unions of finite sets of members).</p>
