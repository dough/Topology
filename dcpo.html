<p>Formally <strong>dcpo</strong> means <em>directed-complete</em> partially ordered set.</p>
<p>A set S is <strong>directed</strong> if <em>every finite subset has an upper bound</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>This goes a little farther than saying that there is no entity without any of their properties</li>
<li>It says there is an etity which actually rejects them all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a dcpo such a decision process will reach a result.</p>
<p>Of course the question now will be, how do you find a dcpo.</p>
<p>An ordered set X is a <strong>dcpo</strong> if <em>every subset that is a directed ^-set has a lub</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring an upper bound would just mean “there are entities”;</li>
<li>this requires “there is one and only one”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too surprisingly there is a way to phrase this in our filter language. A directed set generates a nice kind of filter, called a <strong>UF</strong> for <em>union filter</em>.</p>
<p>FACT: <em>O^p is a UF if every element meets the limit set of the filter.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This mean that the limit set actually belongs to the dual.</li>
<li>That is, every element is the limit of a NF which belongs to the dual.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to compare</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have already learned that in a JF every element is a limit of a fJF which belongs to the dual.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, these are NOT the same thing: there are fJF which are not NF.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact:</p>
<p>FACT: “every jJF is a NFi” iff “every JF is a UF”.</p>
<p>A space is called <strong>sober</strong> if every UF is a NF.</p>
<p>There are those who believe that we should only consider sober spaces.</p>
<p>(I am not one of those, because my favorite type of space, the <strong>poset</strong>, is not always sober).</p>
<p>FACT: A UF is prime, of course, since any union of PF is a PF (we already know a join (even of NF) may not be a PF).</p>
<p>A UF has an even stronger property. which is often called <strong>completely prime</strong>.</p>
<p>FACT: <strong>O^p is a UF</strong> iff <em>whenever a member is a union one of the summands is already a member</em>.</p>
<p>In other words taking unions of members does not give you anything new.</p>
<p>A PF was defined by that same statement, limited to joins (that is unions of finite sets of members).</p>
