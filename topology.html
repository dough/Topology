<h3 id="closure-of-a-set">closure of a set</h3>
<p>Perhaps you would suggest it sould be all sets having the same of fewer properties, but that is only the case for certain topologies (the <em>poset</em>s).</p>
<p>Technically we define <em>closed set</em> and then the <em>the closure of a set</em> is the intersection of all closed sets that include it; that is, the smallest closed set that includes the given set.</p>
<h3 id="saturation-of-a-set">saturation of a set</h3>
<h2 id="specialization">Specialization</h2>
<p>One entity is more <em>specialized</em> than another if it has more <em>properties</em>.` That is the whole purpose of taking the closure.</p>
<h3 id="the-specialization-class-of-a-topology">the specialization class of a topology</h3>
<p>There is an entire set of topologies inducing the same closures (and saturations) of points as a given topology, called its specialization class.</p>
<p><strong>the generic topology</strong></p>
<p>This topology is generated by taking the given generic sets (closures of points) as a base for closed sets. It is the smallest topology having the same generic sets.</p>
<p><strong>the saturation topology</strong></p>
<p>This topology is generated by taking the unions of the given saturations (saturations of points) as a base for open sets. It is the largest topology having the same generic sets.</p>
