	<h3>closure of a set</h3>
	<h3>saturation of a set</h3>
	<h3>the specialization class of a topology</h3>
	There is an entire set of topologies inducing the same closures (and saturations) of points
	as a given topology, called its <abbr>specialization class</abbr>.
	<h4>the generic topology</h3>
	This topology is generated by taking the given generic sets (closures of points) 
	as a base for closed sets. It is the smallest topology having the same generic sets.
        <h4>the saturation topology</h3>
	This topology is generated by taking the unions of the given saturations (saturations of points)
	as a base for open sets. It is the largest topology having the same generic sets.
